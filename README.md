# IRDataOps
[Institutional Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_research) from a [DataOps](https://datakitchen.io/the-dataops-cookbook/) perspective.
## Overview
IRDataOps documents the implementation of DataOps principles by Lane DeNicola, Director of Institutional Research for the College of Arts & Sciences at Emory University.  Any resources we develop with potential utility outside the institution will be shared via the site (under an open source license), whether for commentary, as examples, or for operational use.
## Abstract, "Leveraging 'DataOps' in the Small IR Shop" ([AIR Forum 2023](https://www.airweb.org/forum/2023/home), 5/31/2023)
"DataOps," a term coined in 2014, is an approach that looks to improve the quality and speed of data analytics by combining an integrated, process-oriented perspective on data with automation and methods from agile software engineering. Though conceived in the context of "Big Data," the author will argue for the relevance of the approach to institutional research and in particular IR offices with a small (or single-person) staff.  The work presented here will demonstrate how DataOps can be leveraged as a "force multiplier," allowing individual researchers or small teams to reduce labor costs and the risk of error.  Three dimensions of the analytic enterprise--revision control, batching processing, and automated validation--will provide illustrative cases of DataOps application in the context of a four-year liberal arts college with 36 academic departments and an undergraduate enrollment of roughly 5,000.
